# Data-Bootcamp-Final
### Introduction:
  Stocks are quite unpredictable. Their price and volume change every second, having the possibility to rise and fall by a momentous percentage in the blink of an eye. They also don't often follow set or clear patterns which is why they are incredibly difficult to trade for the average person. However, there are metrics such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) and the SMP500 which depict the overall movement and sentiment of the stock market. Throughout this project, I will be comparing the top 500 publicly traded companies to the DJI in order to analyze if there is a cooperation between how these highly traded stocks behave compared to the overall market. The reason I chose the reason the DJI to represent the overall market in my project is because it focuses on 30 large, well-established companies, making it easier to explain trends and movements to a general audience, it is widely reported in the media and is often used as a shorthand for the market's overall health, and it is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more influence on the index's movements which can illustrate the impact of specific high-profile and commonly traded companies on market sentiment. Through this project, I hope to find how strong the correlation is between these prominent stocks and the overall market, and to what extent these individual stocks follow the trend of the market overall. 
Furthemore, these predictions will help people decide whether to invest in a stock based on the trends and predictions of DJI, making investing much easier for the average person. Due to the mass amounts of descriptive and often updating news about the DJI (due to the fact often used as a shorthand for the market's overall health in the media), it will be much easier for an average person to read headlines and determine if they would like to invest into certain stocks. 

### Data Description:
  In my search to find a data set or api which would be able to provide me with the stock information I needed for this project, I realized that there weren’t many widely available for my use. Instead, I decided to develop my own data set using yfinance. Firstly, I took a wikipedia url which listed the top 500 companies on the stock market and transformed it into a list. This list was then used to create a data set containing the open price, daily high, daily low, close price, adjusted close price and volume for all of the stocks in the list from the past 5 years. Additionally, I added the DJI and SMP500 to this data set. 
  
  For my preliminary research, I initially believed I could find a correlation between volume and price (high) so I graphed it on a scatter plot. My results were inconclusive as the data was heavily clustered around two points which made it evident that there was not much, if any correlation between price and volume. Furthermore, I then plotted the cumulative percent change in DJI, the index which I chose to represent the whole market, against the percent change of the SMP500, the index which represents the 500 companies in my data set as a whole. Through this, I discovered that both indexes have an incredibly similar, almost identical, percent change based on the shape of the graphs. To further solidify my hypothesis, I plotted the normalized prices (the stock price divided by the moving average which removes short term fluctuations, therefore smoothing out the data) of both and the shapes of the graphs were identical to the shapes of the previously plotted percent change graphs. This research proved that there in fact is a cooperation between the 500 stocks in my data swt and the DJI. To further my observations, I decided to plot the percent change of individual stocks against the percent change of the DJI and SMP500. I wrote code which allowed me to input a ticker of any of the stocks in my data frame and plot its percent change. I tested a few tickers such as TSLA, AAPL, AMZN and observed that they do relatively follow the same trend as the graphs of the DJI and SMP500 with varying fluctuations which allowed me to solidify my hypothesis that there is a substantial amount of correlation between the stocks in my data set and DJI. 
  
### Models and Methods
Inorder to evaluate the success of the other models I will use in my project, I decided that due to its simplicity, I used a baseline model to find the Mean Squared Error of the correlation between the DJI and the other stocks  to serve as the benchmark for which i will be comparing the performance of the other models I chose to. 

For my second model, I decided to use sklearn’s time series model to evaluate the correlation between the percent change in the DJI and the rest of the stocks in my dataset. I chose sklearn because it offers a flexible, efficient, and well-documented framework for building time series models. The library’s built-in support for cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning ensures that I can train robust models while avoiding overfitting, which is particularly important when working with complex and often fluctuating financial data. Sklearn also allows for straightforward integration of lagged features, which is crucial when exploring the relationships between past changes in the DJI and their potential impact on other stocks. Additionally, sklearn can evaluate feature importance, which allows me to see which individual stock had the highest correlation with the DJI, and making it simpler for the average investor to know which stock is most likely to provide them with similar returns to the DJI. 

For my third model, I decided to use an exponential smoothing model to focus on the short-term dynamics of the relationship, as it places greater emphasis on recent observations. Unlike the time series, which may require explicit feature engineering to highlight recent trends, exponential smoothing inherently gives more weight to recent data through its time-decaying structure. This makes it particularly useful when analyzing stock market behavior over shorter timeframes, where the most recent movements often have the most predictive value. Exponential smoothing also excels at isolating patterns of randomness, which is crucial in financial data characterized by high volatility and frequent fluctuations. By smoothing the data, it helps me clearly observe trends, seasonality, and immediate impacts of recent changes in DJI on other stocks.

For my fourth model, I decided to use a time series random forest (TSRF) to find the correlation between the percent change in the DJI and the rest of the stocks. Unlike sklearn’s standard random forest, which assumes independence between observations, TSRF is specifically designed to handle time-dependent data by accounting for time-related patterns and lagged features. This makes it ideal for stock market data, where historical patterns and trends can influence future movements. The TSRF model allows me to incorporate lagged variables and additional time-based features, enabling a deeper understanding of both immediate and delayed correlations between the DJI and other stocks. Furthermore, TSRF captures complex, non-linear relationships between variables, which are often present in financial markets due to sector-specific dynamics and macroeconomic influences. This flexibility makes TSRF a powerful tool for analyzing the nuanced interactions between stock movements. Additionally, I integrated a hidden Markov model (HMM) as a feature in the analysis, comparing the percent change of the DJI to the percent change of other stocks. HMMs are particularly useful for identifying underlying states or regimes, such as bullish or bearish market conditions, based on observed data. By encoding these regimes as a feature, I can enhance the TSRF model's ability to capture context-specific correlations. For example, the relationship between the DJI and other stocks may vary significantly depending on whether the market is in a volatile or stable state. By combining the predictive strength of TSRF with the regime-detection capabilities of HMM, I want to try to improve the overall performance of my models.
